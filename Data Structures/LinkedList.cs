            //a Linked List is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. a Linked List consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list

            //Linked List vs Array:

            //Array: stores elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calulable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index
            //Linked List: Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguos locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element

            //MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AN ARRAY AND A LINKED LIST:
            //Array - stored in a contiguous location
            //      - fixed in size
            //      - memory is allocated at compile time
            //      - uses less memory than linked lists
            //      - elements can be accessed easily
            //      - insertion and deletion operation takes time

            //Linked List - not stored in a contiguous location
            //            - dynamic in size
            //            - memory is allocated at run time
            //            - uses more memory because it stores both data and the address of the next node
            //            - element accessing requires the traversal of whole linked list
            //            - insertion and deletion operation is faster
