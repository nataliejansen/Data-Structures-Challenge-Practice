            //It is not only used for organizing the data, but it is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
            //There are 2 types of data structures - Linear and Non-Linear

            //Linear data structure: A data strructure in which elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. (EX: array, stack, linked list, etc)
              //Static data structure: has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. (EX: array)
              //Dynamic data structure: In a dynamic data structire, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory(space) complexity of the code. (EX: queue or stack)
            //Non-Linear data structure: Where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly. We can't traverse(travel through, across or over) all the elements in a single run only. (EX: trees and graphs)
